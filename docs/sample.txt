# Espresso Drinks

Latte: Espresso with steamed milk and a thin layer of foam. Ratio is 1:3 (espresso to milk). Mild, creamy taste.

Cappuccino: Espresso with equal parts steamed milk and foam. Ratio is 1:1:1. Stronger coffee flavor than latte, more foam.

Americano: Espresso diluted with hot water. Similar strength to drip coffee but different flavor profile.

Macchiato: Espresso "stained" with a small amount of foam. Strong espresso taste with just a touch of milk.

Mocha: Espresso with chocolate and steamed milk. Sweeter, dessert-like coffee drink.

Flat White: Similar to latte but with microfoam and stronger espresso flavor. Originated in Australia/New Zealand.

# Brewing Methods

Pour-over: Hot water poured over grounds in a filter. Clean, bright flavor. Takes 3-4 minutes.

French Press: Grounds steeped in hot water, then pressed. Full-bodied, rich flavor. Takes 4 minutes.

Espresso: High pressure forces hot water through fine grounds. Concentrated, intense flavor. Takes 25-30 seconds.

Cold Brew: Grounds steeped in cold water for 12-24 hours. Smooth, low acidity.

Drip Coffee: Automatic machine drips hot water over grounds. Convenient, consistent results.

# Roast Levels

Light Roast: Light brown color. Bright acidity, fruity notes. Highest caffeine content.

Medium Roast: Medium brown. Balanced flavor, some acidity. Most popular choice.

Dark Roast: Dark brown to black. Bold, smoky, bitter-sweet. Lower caffeine than light roast.

# Coffee Basics

Caffeine: Average cup has 80-100mg. Espresso shot has about 63mg but is more concentrated.

Decaf: Not caffeine-free, contains 2-15mg per cup. Made by removing caffeine from beans before roasting.

Grind Size: Finer grind for espresso, coarser for French press. Wrong grind causes over or under extraction.

Water Temperature: Ideal is 195-205°F (90-96°C). Too hot burns coffee, too cold under-extracts.

Storage: Keep beans in airtight container at room temperature. Use within 2-4 weeks of roasting.
